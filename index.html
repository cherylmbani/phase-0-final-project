            <h2> Know Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am 25-year-old GIS Analyst based in Nairobi, originally from the beautiful county of Migori. I graduated from the Technical University of Kenya with a focus on Geographic Information Systems, and I’m currently expanding my skill set at Moringa School, where I’m studying software engineering. I believe that combining GIS with tech skills like programming gives me a competitive edge and opens up exciting opportunities across industries. Outside of work and studies, I enjoy cooking delicious meals, binge-watching K-drama series, and getting lost in a good book. I’m also a proud sibling among four, and I’m passionate about lifelong learning, creativity, and using technology to solve real-world problems.
